.SH NAME
rmid \- RMI activation system daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rmid 
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "RMI activation system daemon" "" "RMI activation system daemon \(em \fLrmid\fP"
.IX "rmid" "" "\fLrmid\fP \(em RMI activation system daemon"
The
.B rmid 
tool starts the activation system daemon. Before
activatable objects can be either registered with the activation
system or activated in a Java VM, the activation system daemon
must be started.
See the
.I RMI Specification
and
.I Activation Tutorials
for details on how to
write programs that use activatable remote objects.
.LP
The daemon can
be started by executing the
.B rmid
command, and specifying a security policy file, as follows:
.LP
.ti +5n
.B example% rmid \-J\-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy
.LP
Note: When running Sun's implementation of
.BR rmid ,
by default you will need to specify a security policy
file so that
.B rmid can verify whether or not the information in each
.B ActivationGroupDesc
is allowed to be used to launch a JVM for an activation group.
Specifically, the command and options specified by the
.B CommandEnvironment
and any
.B Properties
passed to an
.BR ActivationGroupDesc 's
constructor must now be
explicitly allowed in the security policy file for
.BR rmid .
The value of the
.B sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy
property dictates the policy that
.B rmid
uses to determine whether or not the information in an
.B ActivationGroupDesc
may be used to launch a JVM for an activation group.
.LP
Executing
.B rmid
by default 
.RS
.TP 2
\(bu
starts the Activator and an internal registry on the default port,
.BR 1098 ,
and 
.PD 0
.TP
\(bu
binds an
.B ActivationSystem
to the name
.B java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem
in this internal registry. 
.PD
.RE
.LP
To specify an alternate port for the registry,
you must specify the
.B \-port
option when starting up
.BR rmid .
For example,
.sp 1n
.ti +5n
.B rmid \-J\-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy \-port 1099
.sp 1n
starts the activation system daemon and
a registry on the registry's default port,
.BR 1099 .
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.BI \-C someCommandLineOption
Specifies an option that is passed as a command-line argument
to each child process (activation group) of 
.B rmid 
when that
process is created. 
For example, you could pass a property to each Java
virtual machine spawned by the activation system daemon: 
.sp 1n
.ti +5n
.B rmid \-C\-Dsome.property=value
.sp 1n
This ability to pass command-line arguments 
o child processes can be useful for debugging.
For example, the following command: 
.sp 1n
.ti +5n
.B rmid \-C\-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true
.sp 1n
will enable server-call logging in all child JVMs.
.TP
.BI \-J someCommandLineOption
Specifies an option that is passed to the
java interpreter running
.BR rmid .
For example, to specify that
.B rmid
use a policy file named
.BR rmid.policy ,
the
.B \-J
option can be used to define the
.B java.security.policy
property on
.BR rmid 's
command line.
For example: 
.sp 1n
.ti +5n
.B rmid \-J\-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy
.TP
.BI \-J\-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy= policy 
Specifies the policy that
.B rmid
employs to check commands and command-line options used to
launch the JVM in which an activation group runs.
Please note that this option exists only in Sun's
implementation of the RMI activation daemon.
If this property is not specified on the command line,
the result is the same as if
.B \-J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=default
were specified.
The possible values of
.I policy
can be
.BR default ,
.IR policyClassName ,
or
.BR none : 
.RS
.TP 2
\(bu
default (or if this property is \f2unspecified\f1)
The default
.B execPolicy
allows
.B rmid
to execute commands with specific command-line options only if
.B rmid
has been granted permission to execute those commands and options
in the security policy file that
.B rmid
uses.
Only the default activation group implementation
can be used with the
.I default
execution policy.
.sp 1n
.B rmid
launches a JVM for an activation group using the
information in the group's registered activation
group descriptor, an
.BR ActivationGroupDesc .
The group descriptor specifies an optional
.B ActivationGroupDesc.CommandEnvironment
which includes the
.I command
to execute to start the
activation group as well as any
command line
.I options
to be added to the command line.
By default,
.B rmid
uses the
.B java
command found in
.BR java.home .
The group descriptor also contains
.I properties
overrides that are added to the command line as options defined as: 
.sp 1n
.ti +5n
.BI \-D property = value
.sp 1n
The permission
.B com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
is used to grant
.B rmid
permission to execute a
command, specified in the group descriptor's
.B CommandEnvironment
to launch an activation group.
The permission
.B com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
is used to allow
.B rmid
to use command-line options, specified as
properties overrides in the group descriptor or as options in the
.BR CommandEnvironment ,
when launching the activation group. 
.sp 1n
When granting
.B rmid
permission to execute various commands and options,
the permissions
.B ExecPermission
and
.B ExecOptionPermission
need to be granted universally
(that is, granted to all code sources). 
.RS
.TP 7
.B ExecPermission
The
.B ExecPermission
class represents permission for
.B rmid
to execute a specific command to launch an activation group.
.sp 1n
.B Syntax
.br
The name of an
.B ExecPermission
is the path name of a command to grant
.B rmid
permission to execute.
A path name that ends in "/*" indicates
all the files contained in that directory (where "/"
is the file-separator character,
.BR File.separatorChar ).
A path name that ends with "/-" indicates
all files and subdirectories contained in that directory (recursively).
A path name consisting of
the special token "<<ALL FILES>>" matches
.I any
file. 
.sp 1n
.B Note:
A path name consisting of a
single "*" indicates all the files in the current directory,
while a path name consisting of
a single "-" indicates all the files
in the current directory and
(recursively) all files and
subdirectories contained in the current directory. 
.TP
.B ExecOptionPermission
The
.B ExecOptionPermission
class represents permission for
.B rmid
to use a specific command-line
option when launching an activation group.
The name of an
.B ExecOptionPermission
is the value of a command line option.
.sp 1n
.B Syntax
.br
Options support a limited wildcard scheme.
An asterisk signifies a wildcard match, and it may
appear as the option name itself
(that is, it matches any option),
or an asterisk may appear at the end
of the option name only if the
asterisk follows either a "." or "=". 
.sp 1n
For example: "*" or "\-Dfoo.*" or "-Da.b.c=*" is valid;
"*foo" or "-Da*b" or "ab*" is not.
.RE
.TP
.B Policy file for rmid
When granting
.B rmid
permission to execute various commands and options,
the permissions
.B ExecPermission
and
.B ExecOptionPermission
need to be granted universally (that is, granted to all code
sources).
It is safe to grant these permissions
universally because only
.B rmid
checks these permissions.
.sp 1n
An example policy file that
grants various execute permissions to
.B rmid
is: 
.sp 1n
.ft 3
.nf
grant {
    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
        "/files/apps/java/jdk1.2.2/solaris/bin/java";

    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
        "/files/apps/java/jdk1.2.2/solaris/bin/java_g";

    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
        "/files/apps/rmidcmds/*";

    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
        "\-Djava.security.policy=/files/policies/group.policy";

    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
        "\-Djava.security.debug=*";

    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
        "\-Dsun.rmi.*";
};
.fi
.ft 1
.sp 1n
The first two permissions granted allow
.B rmid
to execute the 1.2.2 version of the
.B java
and
.B java_g
commands, specified by their explicit path names.
Note that by default, the version of the
.B java
command found in
.B java.home
is used (the same one that
.B rmid
uses), and does not need to be
specified in the policy file.
The third permission allows
.B rmid
to execute any command in the
directory
.BR /files/apps/rmidcmds .
.sp 1n
The fourth permission granted, an
.BR ExecOptionPermission ,
allows
.B rmid
to launch an activation
group that defines the security policy file to be
.BR /files/policies/group.policy .
The next permission allows the
.B java.security.debug
property to be used by an activation group.
The last permission allows any property in the
.B sun.rmi
property name hierarchy to be used by activation groups.
.sp 1n
To start
.B rmid
with a policy file, the
.B java.security.policy
property needs to be specified on
.BR rmid 's
command line.
For example: 
.sp 1n
.ti +5n
.B rmid \-J\-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy 
.TP 2
\(bu
.I policyClassName
.sp 1n
If the default behavior is not flexible enough,
an administrator can provide, when starting
.BR rmid ,
the name of a class whose
.B checkExecCommand
method is executed in order to check commands to be executed by
.BR rmid .
.sp 1n
The
.B policyClassName
specifies a public class with a public,
no-argument constructor and an
implementation of the following
.B checkExecCommand
method: 
.sp 1n
.ft 3
.nf
.in +5n
public void checkExecCommand(ActivationGroupDesc desc,
                                         String[] command)
                throws SecurityException;
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.sp 1n
Before launching an activation group,
.B rmid
calls the policy's
.BR checkExecCommand
method, passing it the activation group descriptor
and an array containing the complete
command to launch the activation group.
If the
.B checkExecCommand
throws a
.BR SecurityException ,
.B rmid
will not launch the activation group
and an
.B ActivationException
will be thrown to the caller attempting to activate the object. 
.TP
\(bu
.B none
.sp 1n
If the
.B sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy
property value is "none", then
.B rmid
will not perform any
validation of commands to launch activation groups. 
.RE
.TP
.BI \-log " dir"
Specifies the name of the directory the activation
system daemon uses to write its database and
associated information.
The log directory defaults to creating a directory,
.BR log ,
in the directory in
which the
.B rmid
command was executed. 
.TP
.BI \-port " port"
Specifies the port
.BR rmid 's
registry uses.
The activation system daemon binds the
.BR ActivationSystem ,
with the name
.BR java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem ,
in this registry.
Thus, the
.B ActivationSystem
on the local machine can be obtained using
the following
.B Naming.lookup
method call: 
.LP
.RS 
.ft 3
.nf
import java.rmi.*;
import java.rmi.activation.*;

ActivationSystem system;
system = (ActivationSystem)
Naming.lookup("//:port/java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem");
.fi
.ft 1
.RE
.TP
.B \-stop
Stops the current invocation of
.BR rmid , 
for a port specified by the 
.B \-port 
option.
If no 
.I port 
is specified, it will stop the
.B rmid
running on port
.BR 1098 .
